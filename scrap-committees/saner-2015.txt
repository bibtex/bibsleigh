DocSymCh  Peter C. Rigby
          is an assistant professor in Software Engineering at Concordia University in Montreal. His overarching research interest is in understanding how developers collaborate to produce successful software systems. His research program is driven by a desire to determine empirically the factors that lead to the development of successful software and to adapt, apply, and validate these techniques in different settings. Empirical Software Engineering involves mining large data sets to provide an empirical basis for software engineering practices. Software Analytics is then used to provide statistical predictions of, for example, the areas of the system that would benefit from increased developer attention. Grounded, empirical findings are necessary to advance software development as an engineering discipline. He is currently focusing on three research areas: extracting salient code elements (e.g., classes, methods) from informal documentation (e.g., StackOverflow), lightweight industrial software peer review techniques (at Microsoft, AMD, and DND), and the impact of disruptive events on software products. He currently holds two grants to fund this research: an NSERC Discovery Grant and a DND/NSERC Research Partnership Grant.

PractCh   Wahab Hamou-Lhadj
          leads the Software Behaviour Analysis (SBA) Research Lab to investigate techniques and tools to help software analysts understand and analyze the behaviour of complex software systems. The term 'software behaviour' includes the interactions that occur within the software itself (micro interactions) and between software and its environment (macro interactions). Wahab looks at software from the ecosystem perspective. The outcome of our research can help with a variety of applications: software comprehension, software maintenance and evolution, performance analysis, anomaly detection, software compliance and certification, etc.

DemoCh    Emily Hill
          Today's software is large and complex, with systems consisting of millions of lines of code. New developers to a software project face significant challenges in locating code related to their maintenance tasks of fixing bugs or adding new features. Developers can simply be assigned a bug and told to fix it—even when they have no idea where to begin. In fact, research has shown that a developer typically spends more time locating and understanding code during maintenance than modifying it. Emily Hill works to significantly reduce the cost of software maintenance by reducing the time and effort to find and understand the code relevant to a software maintenance task. Emily's primary research interests are in software engineering; specifically, her work focuses on reducing software maintenance costs through building intuitive software engineering and program comprehension tools. Her research is inter-disciplinary and combines aspects of software engineering, program analysis, natural language processing, computational linguistics, information retrieval, text mining, and machine learning.
