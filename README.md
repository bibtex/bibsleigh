# BibSLEIGH
## Bibliography of Software Language Engineering in Generated Hypertext

The extensive approach to SLE bibliography. Work in progress.

Main points of interest:
* **[bibtex.github.io](http://bibtex.github.io)** — the frontend (mostly HTML/JS)
* **[@slebok/bibsleigh](https://github.com/slebok/bibsleigh/)** — the corpus (mostly JSON)
* **[@bibtex/bibsleigh](https://github.com/bibtex/bibsleigh/)** — some software to maintain it (mostly Python)

The mastermind behind this ~~hack~~/project is **[@grammarware](http://grammarware.github.io/)**.
