# BibSLEIGH
## Bibliography of Software Language Engineering in Generated Hypertext

A project on facilitated browsing of scientific knowledge objects in software language engineering.

Work in progress.

Main points of interest:
* **[bibtex.github.io](http://bibtex.github.io)** — the frontend (mostly HTML/JS)
* **[@slebok/bibsleigh](https://github.com/slebok/bibsleigh/)** — the corpus, tags, bundles, people (mostly JSON)
* **[@bibtex/bibsleigh](https://github.com/bibtex/bibsleigh/)** — the toolkit with import/export/refine scripts (mostly Python)

Sources used:
* [DBLP](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/), including [XML dumps](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/xml/)
* [@tue-mdse/conferenceMetrics](https://github.com/tue-mdse/conferenceMetrics) — bibliometrics for SE conferences

The mastermind behind this ~~hack~~/project is **[@grammarware](http://grammarware.github.io/)**.
